# Data Visualization Graph Selection Guide

This guide helps you select the appropriate graph based on the type of data you're working with and the insights you want to convey.

## 1. Comparison
- **Bar Chart**: For comparing quantities across different categories. Best for discrete, categorical data.
  - **When to Use**: Comparing sales by product, revenue by year, or population by region.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: For comparing parts to the whole across categories.
  - **When to Use**: Comparing the market share of companies by year.
- **Grouped Bar Chart**: For comparing multiple groups or categories side by side.
  - **When to Use**: Comparing student scores across different subjects.

## 2. Trend (Time Series Analysis)
- **Line Chart**: For showing trends over time. Ideal for continuous data like time-based variables.
  - **When to Use**: Showing stock prices over time, temperature changes, or sales trends.
- **Area Chart**: Similar to line charts but with shaded areas below the line.
  - **When to Use**: Showing total revenue over time with emphasis on the volume of change.

## 3. Relationship / Correlation
- **Scatter Plot**: For showing the relationship between two continuous variables.
  - **When to Use**: Showing the relationship between marketing spend and sales, or height and weight.
- **Bubble Chart**: An extension of scatter plots, where a third variable is represented by the size of the points.
  - **When to Use**: Visualizing the relationship between sales, profit, and region.

## 4. Composition (Part-to-Whole Relationship)
- **Pie Chart**: For showing parts of a whole when there are fewer categories (usually 3-6).
  - **When to Use**: Showing market share by company, budget allocation, or proportion of customer types.
- **Donut Chart**: A variation of pie charts with a clean center for labels.
  - **When to Use**: Showing revenue share by product categories.
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Vertical stacked bar charts for showing part-to-whole relationships over time.
  - **When to Use**: Showing annual revenue from different products.

## 5. Distribution
- **Histogram**: For showing the distribution of a single continuous variable.
  - **When to Use**: Showing the distribution of ages in a population, or test scores in a class.
- **Box Plot**: For comparing distributions through five statistics (min, Q1, median, Q3, max).
  - **When to Use**: Comparing salaries across different regions.
- **Violin Plot**: For displaying distributions with a richer visual than box plots.
  - **When to Use**: Showing customer satisfaction scores across different age groups.

## 6. Geographical Data
- **Choropleth Map**: For showing geographic variations in data, with color-coded regions.
  - **When to Use**: Showing population density by region or median income by state.
- **Scatter Plot Map**: Combine a scatter plot with a map to represent data points geographically.
  - **When to Use**: Plotting customer locations, incidents, or stores on a map.

## 7. Ranking
- **Bar Chart (Horizontal)**: For displaying rankings in a horizontal format.
  - **When to Use**: Ranking countries by population or sales by employee.

## 8. Parts-to-Whole
- **Treemap**: For showing hierarchical data as nested rectangles.
  - **When to Use**: Visualizing revenue contribution by department.

## 9. Hierarchy or Relationship (Nested Structures)
- **Tree Diagram (Dendrogram)**: A hierarchical tree structure.
  - **When to Use**: Organizational charts or family trees.

## 10. Multidimensional Data
- **Heatmap**: For visualizing relationships in multi-dimensional data with color-coded intensity.
  - **When to Use**: Visualizing correlation between multiple variables.
- **Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**: For comparing multi-dimensional data.
  - **When to Use**: Comparing performance metrics across multiple dimensions.
